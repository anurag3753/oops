Tell me about youself ?

Define Anurag Modi ?
- I define myself as a person, who is self motivated and highly organized with his work. I try to improve my efficiency with each passing day. My philosophy goes as, if I am able to do a task in 1 hour. Then I always push myself to find out a better, more efficient way to finish the task quickly. Further I also believe in finding solutions to problem, considering bigger picture in mind. So that I can scale it with the new requirements.

- Vitis wrapper that i developed, it is core of xilinx build framework.

Why you want to join Qualcomm ?
-  I am good in developing test automation while considering both scalability and maintainability in mind. My core competency is in python and pytest. I feel the work at Qualcomm would be both exciting and a great learning opportunity.

What role do you play in team ?
    - I have served various roles in Xilinx. Initially I worked as an individual contributor. Where my tasks rotate around discussing with various components owners, try to understand their flow. And they without disturbing their day-to-day tasks. Keep the parallel migration activity going on.
    - I forked a separate branch. Keep on individually testing on it. And once finally done. I merge those with the main branch.
    - I was being provided open ended problems like, explore and find an easy reporting tool, which should be free to use :- Allure
    - Asked to explore on ROBOT framework, I explored both pros and cons and suggested why to use pytest over robot. 
    - Currently we used pytest only in our new framework.

How do you prioritize your tasks?
    - When I need to prioritize, I first make a list of all items in my bucket.
    - Then reorder them in order of their due date.
    - Along with this, the tasks which need involvement from other teams, may be in terms of information gathering etc. I parallely starts those tasks, so that by i will be able to finish the tasks in time.

Why you want to leave your current company ??
    - I am always open to learning new stuff. I am with xilinx for past 3.5 years. Currently my role has come to a saturation level, where the things are repeating more and and learning has become lesser.
    - I believe taking up role with Qualcomm, will challenge me to learn new things.
